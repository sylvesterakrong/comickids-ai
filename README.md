#Visualizing Understanding
###A Generative AI Comic-Based Learning Assistant for Enhancing Concept Engagement in Ghanaian Primary Classrooms

##Overview
Visualizing Understanding is a lightweight web-based educational tool designed to support foundational learning in low-resource primary schools in Ghana. By leveraging Google's Gemini 2.0 Flash API, the system generates curriculum-aligned comic strips enriched with culturally relevant visuals to improve engagement and conceptual understanding among students aged 8–11.

This project aligns with UN SDG 4: “Ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all.”
